Zendaya gives a brief explanation of who these people are, but to further amplify these black people, I decided to included their names, and a brief note about them. -->

I decided to use this particular website because this is a blog (BGLH) run by a black woman which was mentioned in one of our past readings by Catherine Knight Steele.-->
          relishing in rave outfit reviews, but because I was hit with ignorant slurs and pure <lb/>
          disrespect. To say that an 18 year old young woman with <choice><orig><abbr>locs</abbr></orig><reg>(dreadlocks)</reg></choice> must smell of <lb/>
          patchouli oil or “weed” is not only a large stereotype but outrageously offensive. <lb/>
          I don’t usually feel the need to respond to negative things but certain remarks cannot <lb/>
          go unchecked. I’ll have you know my father, brother, best childhood friend and <lb/>
          little cousins all have have locs. Do you want to know what <persName ref="#ADV">Ava DuVernay</persName> <lb/>

          ignorant people who choose to judge others based on the curl of their hair. <seg type="natural-hair">My <lb/><!-- This is an example of freedom language because Zendaya is using her hairstyle as a method of liberation in the sense that black hair is often seen in a negative light, and by wearing locs to such a prestigious event, Zendaya is liberating herself and others of sociwties perception of good hair. -->
          wearing my hair in locs on an Oscar red carpet was to showcase them in a positive <lb/>

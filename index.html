<p>A narrative about the study and preservation of black people engaging in digital spaces already exists. This narrative includes how African Americans communicated in the past and its relation to the present. This communication as a form of discourse has created a way in which African Americans define their freedom in the world. The preservation of this freedom has been severely lacking. Often, traditional archives have excluded the voices of African Americans, and its digital spaces that have overcome this exclusionary border wall placed by conventional archives. For example, from Dr. Lu’s dissertation, in the late 1700s, Benjamin Banneker wrote a letter to Thomas Jefferson asking him to rethink the way in which he speaks about African Americans, as it created a false narrative.1 In this case, Thomas Jefferson acts as the traditional archive system, excluding and creating a faulty history of black people. Rather than perpetuate this exclusion of black people and black voices, few archivists have worked to study and preserve digital spaces as a way to combat the traditional archive system.
</p>
<p>In opposition to the shortcomings of the traditional archive system, digital spaces set a new standard for the preservation of historical materials and events. Simply put, this new standard is the introduction of diversity in the sense that digital spaces are inclusive, written from several points of view, and far easier to engage with. Those with internet access can easily participate in any discourse on platforms such as blogs, social media, film, music, television, etc. This accessibility brings diversity and inclusivity to the people who choose to join in the rhetoric.
Other archivists have already studied the impact of different forms of social media. For instance, Catherine Knight Steele has a particular interest in the implications of blogging. These websites have allowed members to engage with one another through posting material, comments and share features. This communication follows the traditional form of black culture through the use of orality “to preserve Black culture and challenge the dominant culture.”2 Blogs provide the necessary means for an inclusive, easily accessed digital space. Additionally, Sarah Florini’s interest in Twitter as a digital space shows another traditional form of black oral culture--signifying. Signifying is the use of rhetoric, metaphors, irony, wit, and much more as a way to engage in good-natured insults. On Twitter, Florini suggests that this signifying “allows Black users not only to reject colorblindness by actively performing their racial identities but also to connect with other Black users to create and reify a social space for their ‘Blackness’.”3 Twitter is another example of how digital spaces are a way to combat erroneous records of traditional archives.
</p>
<p>Despite the notion that African American hair carries, much historical and social baggage in the African American community,4 this digital movement has a created a sense of community  through social media, where online communities help women learn how to style their natural hair and show them that their natural hair is beautiful, to overcome the fear of being natural. Today’s natural hair movement is about personal empowerment, self-acceptance, freedom, spiritual growth and whole-body health where these online communities “created a sense of pride, strength and even reconnection with self." With the work that has been done in preserving histories that are often left out, we plan to create our own archive--one in which that challenges the traditional archive system while rectifying its flaws. Our goal is to preserve these digital communities by looking at everyday online discourse and how media such as TV, film, YouTube, social media, music, etc. represent natural hair. We are doing so through the use of TEI and Atom to mark up text found online and creating website that is a digital archive that much more accessible than a traditional archive. Our mark up texts include a tweet by Zendaya and the song “I Am Not My Hair” by India.Arie. We feel that both of these texts are excellent representations natural hair in relation to black freedom and digital spaces. Our work will focus black people, natural hair, and the discourse within digital spaces associated with this.
